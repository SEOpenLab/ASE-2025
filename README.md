# ASE-2025
This is the data and code for Coding-Fuse submit to ASE-2025. 

## Instructions
This is the experimental process code and data of the proposed method Coding-Fuse and FMF method, which can be found in the code directory.

If you need to repeat the performance values ​​of the experimental results, we recommend running the test code directly, in each setcode parameter --test part. But before that, you need to (1) first copy the dataset folder to the directory at the same level as code in each fusion folder. (2) Secondly, import the code pre-trained models in the code folder, and we have prepared the file name for you, prepared code PTMs can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/15543665 (3) Finally, you need to import our trained test model (can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/15543870, https://zenodo.org/records/15544997 and ) in saved_models in the code folder. You can get the same performance values ​​as us.

If you need to perform the entire experiment, that is, the entire process from training to testing, we recommend that you directly execute all the commands of setcode, but before that you also need to perform the first two steps above.

If you have any questions, you can leave a message.
