## Additional Results for Experiment
The results of the following three tables are used to support the second half of Observation 4) and the second half of the corresponding analysis, and the second half of the final summary paragraph in <b/>Section Experimental Validation</b>.

This is the performance and greenness comparison of the proposed Coding-Fuse method and the original single model OSM. It can be seen that the <b/>Coding-Fuse can achieve better performance than OSM at the same efficiency and hardware resource level on the code-related classification tasks in both the code embedding scenario and the finetune model scenario.</b>
